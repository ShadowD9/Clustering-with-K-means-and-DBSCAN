# Clustering-with-K-means-and-DBSCAN
Unsupervised machine learning using K-means and DBSCAN on the Iris dataset

Unsupervised machine learning algorithms operate without the need for labeled data during training. Instead, they analyze input data independently, uncovering patterns or structures without explicit guidance. Clustering is a common unsupervised approach that groups similar data points based on their features, with examples including K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms. In essence, unsupervised learning is instrumental in exploring data structure, unveiling hidden patterns, and preprocessing data for tasks like classification or regression. Its utility shines particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or unavailable.

We will see in this project how this clusteting models works and which one clusters the flowers data closer to the real flowers.
